## Next Steps

Once you've got a CPU Emulator there's a plethora of options for further exploration:

* You could write a [whole-system emulator](https://github.com/redline6561/famiclom) using that CPU.
* You could write a simple compiler targeting that CPU.
* You could write a [static analyzer](https://github.com/redline6561/trowel) to compute the
[CFG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph) of binaries for that CPU.
* You could [port it to the web](https://github.com/redline6561/cljs-6502) to bring your code to a wider audience.

Whatever you do, I hope you enjoyed reading through **cl-6502**. Happy Hacking!
