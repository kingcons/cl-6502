## `packages.lisp`: Exposed Functionality

Finally, we'll want to define packages for our emulator to provide a public API.
Who knows, maybe somebody out there is just dying for a drag and drop 6502
emulator in Lisp with a function to single-step instructions. :)

The `6502` package is for use by emulator writers, the test suite, etc. It
exposes all the types and interesting high-level functionality. It also shadows
Common Lisp's built-in `and` and `bit` symbols since they name 6502 opcodes.

The `cl-6502` package is more limited and designed for public consumption,
hiding the Addressing Modes and their protocol, the CPU slot accessors, and
other helpers.
